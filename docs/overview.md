# Project Overview

Welcome to the Kotlin Basic Template Project!

This project serves as a minimal starting point for Kotlin development targeting the JVM. It is designed to be lightweight, easy to understand, and flexible enough to expand into more complex applications.

## Goals
- Provide a clean and simple Kotlin setup
- Avoid unnecessary tooling (no CI/CD, no GitHub Actions)
- Encourage documentation-first development
- Serve as a base for CLI tools, microservices, or learning projects

## Technologies Used
- Kotlin (JVM)
- Gradle Kotlin DSL
- JUnit for testing
